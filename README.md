# FEND Project 01 - Build a portfolio site v1

For this project a mock-up was given to replicate the design using HTML and CSS.
The site should be be responsive and will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio project.

_***Additions:**_ _the mock-up seem off w/o contact info so I added a footer with the contact info of the developer and copy/legal stuff. Also I make it minimalist_
